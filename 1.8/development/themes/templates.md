Templates are HTML snippets that make up the layout of your board, which are stored in the database. Templates are a very important part of your forum's style.

Usually each theme has its own templates, but multiple themes can use the same template set too. Every template set contains all of the templates that make up your forum's layout.

Templates are located at your **Admin Control Panel -> Templates & Style -> Templates**.

## Global & Themes Templates

There have 2 types of templates: global templates, which are used by all themes and theme templates (they are named `<theme name> Templates`).

### Global Templates

Global templates are used in all styles. They are usually templates added by plugins or similar.

### Themes Templates

These templates are used by themes at your forum. Usually, every each theme has its own templates, as they can be changed for each theme.

## Managing Templates

When you click `<theme name> Templates` or Default templates, you will get a list of all **template sets** (or **template groups**).
Here you can expand sets and find template files when you click on a template group name, or **Expand** right to it.
