0. ### Repository Maintenance

   The version is updated in:
   - `MyBB::$version`, `MyBB::$version_code` (_inc/class_core.php_),
   - `$langinfo['version']` in the English language manifest (_inc/languages/english.php_),
   - `version` attributes of `<theme>`, `<stylesheet>`, `<template>` depending on changes (_install/resources/mybb_theme.xml_).

   Target version milestones are removed from unresolved Issues and Pull Requests.


1. ### Package Building and Testing
   The [mybb/mybb-build](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build) build script is used to perform tasks related to preparing releasable packages and associated information.
   The output is securely shared between Team members and tested.

2. ### Announcements Preparation

   The package- and version-related information is completed and verified internally:

   - [version metadata](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com/tree/gh-pages/_versions/) for Release Notes, partially generated by the build script,
   - Release [Blog](https://blog.mybb.com/) Post, fully generated by Jekyll basing on the version metadata at `/versions/release-blog-post/` (locally),
   - [plugin hooks data](https://github.com/mybb/docs.mybb.com/blob/gh-pages/_data/18_plugin_hooks.yml), fully generated by the build script,
   - [file checksums](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com/tree/gh-pages/checksums), fully generated by the build script.

3. ### Publication

   The packages and associated information are published. The tasks listed should be executed within the shortest timespan possible; the order is security-sensitive.

   1. the file checksums are uploaded to [`mybb.com/checksums/`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com/tree/gh-pages/checksums),
   2. the packages are uploaded to `resources.mybb.com` and verified,
   3. the version metadata is pushed to the repository, adding Release Notes and updating MyBB.com pages,
   4. the Release Blog Post is published,
   5. the Release Blog Post is propagated to public channels:

      - [@mybbsecurity](https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity) on Twitter (in accordance with [rules](https://github.com/mybb/meta-internal/blob/master/docs/social-twitter-mybbsecurity.md)),
      - [@mybb](https://twitter.com/mybb) on Twitter,
      - `#18-support` channel on Discord (pinned message).

4. ### Repository Updates

   1. A `MyBB 1.8.x` synchronization commit, containing any changes that have been applied outside the public repository, is pushed and tagged (`mybb_18xx`),
   2. a [Release](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/releases) is created and all packages are attached,
   3. the version metadata is updated to list GitHub as a download source for the packages.

5. ### Documentation Updates
   The plugin hooks data is pushed to the Docs repository.
