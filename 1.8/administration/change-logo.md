Follow this procedure if you want to change the logo at the top-left of your board.

- Upload your logo to your webserver.
- Go to **Admin CP --> Themes** --> Click on your theme name
- Change the **Board Logo** path to your new logo.

Alternatively, you can replace the original images/logo.png with your own logo (but your logo must be in .png). However, this method may not work with custom themes.
